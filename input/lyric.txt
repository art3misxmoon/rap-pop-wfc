Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Who am I?
Rec League, I ain't payin' to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah. I murder some, I murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah what you saying to it?
Old money look no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ey
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her Boooty)
What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke brothers when they Black & Mild
So we acting out
Ok cool
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Blue dream by the bouquet 'til I'm blue faced on a Tuesday
(Can I have some?)
#brothersBeLike
Put a plus eighteen on that e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah nah, they can't hold me
June/July, drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut brothers, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like it's 2 Chainz
Blue Blood like he both gangs
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone




Blow up
World Star before rap, you already know that
So Fresh Prince, they are about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Phone call gotta say Moshi Moshi
Girlfriend actin' all washy washy
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Fell in love with a brotha like a mermaid
(Daddy, I love him!)
That's a first date
Nobody think about it worst case
Best case, we the front page
10K on the first day
Yeah, motherfucker, take your phone out
To record this
Ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less, a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals
Tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action, I'm a be Scorcese
(My brotha hold it horizontal man, Be professional)
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine
Thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk
But I saw through it like a wet shirt
Drive slow cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop
When I heard shots
Watchin' dude drop from a Glock at a
Let me flash on 'em
We all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talkin', you know the sound
Brrrr, money counting
Brrrr, AK
Brrrr, cell phone
Brrrr, hello?
Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man
This shit's hilarious, man. It's like this kid, man
He got like, he got like hit on the side of the head
Man, he's like freakin' out
Like, it's like
We don't wanna be a (worldstar!)
And all I wanna be is a (worldstar!)

At a Clippers game on the courtside (side)
Watch a brotha shoot like a 4-5 (five)
They mad at me, too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you, "Go home, Roger" (go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you brothers like apartheid (nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate
Instead of asking what's happenin' rather blastin'
Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker
Than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playin' Playstation
Why you standin' there? Say some', girl say some'
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house
All she needed was some (all she needed was some)

Bought a new bath (bath), 8K, brotha
Wanna take shots? (Shots) AK, brotha
When I ball, I'ma ball King James, brotha
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, brotha
And I'm out of this world like Tang, brotha (Tang, brotha)
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you wanna play pool on my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors
All she needed was some (all she needed was some)
All she needed was some (all she needed was some)
All she needed was some (all she needed was some)
All she needed was some (all she needed was some)

Uh-oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no, no, no
Face down in the brown grass
Shame shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do? What you gon' do?
Like, "I can't remember"
Shots fired, rewind, please girl be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before I go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z & Beyonce, my aunt say "Keep the sex game picante"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Put my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
We ain't speaking—
We ain't speaking— (okay)
We ain't speaking though
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen—
The attitude
The attitude
And I hope you understand, I hope you understand
We were never friends
And I hope you understand now
That I messed up (oh no, no-no)
(I hope you understand) I hope you understand
Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understand
I just hope you understand
I just hope you understand
I just hope you understand



I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits till I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around, " then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, no
I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I needed
Now I finally got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a brotha don't like that shit at all
So retreating
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute
Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
I'm really not ready girl
That's a problem
Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know that you choose to stay, no oh
All the girlfriends saying here we go again
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And you're saying it's because of the Internet
Try once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have better
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at her
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me (just hit me)
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move, and we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland




Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
'Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?"

Rich kid, asshole
Paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow
DJ Khaled

PH balance
Real brotha, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so
Hip deep in that Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo, you faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though?
Are you eating though? brotha, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so e-m-o?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese
Yo' girl, she jocking these
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You brothers ain't copping these, brothers ain't looking like me
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (Why)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (Why)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (Why)

Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you
Fuck it, what you gon' do?
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear and your girl drank my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (Silver spoon coon, ho)
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker
Vroom vroom ho
Ain't nobody
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know
Top of the Hold 'em totem, rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half of MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods and I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a
White hood, white hood (Okay-kay-kay)
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dope man, help a brotha re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
"Err-err-err-err": onomatopoeia, oh, I got my cool on! (Tell 'em, mane)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name
Whyyy
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' (Whyy)




No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other brothers, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up (Okay)
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other brothers, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005

I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogain
Or leave it, like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other brothers, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)

Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What does that change?
Can't sleep
3 A.M., stare at the ceilin', murder the feelin'
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate, cornucopia
So be it, say I'm over it
Playin' Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood, look at the cars
Stare at my hands, look at the moon, I can't find it, it's gone
What's wrong? Didn't respond when I texted you last night, you alright? Yeah
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What does that change?
Man there's a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry and half of an apple pie
When I'm laughin', I'm satisfied, when I'm dyin', I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood so good I'mma kill that spider
Them kinda things they told me I no longer do that, but now you finally get it admit it
Go home, lock the door, watch cartoons for an hour turn off the lights, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse
Look at the recluse
Look at the rec
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What does that change?
Don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go





Slide, baby
I'm gonna let it go
No one has to know
Let it slide, baby
I'm gonna let it go
No one has to, no one, no one
Slide, baby
Wow




I had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people
So many pretty faces
I talked to some birds
I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad you were really happy
Because you were here
And I got to meet every star, every planet
Everything that made me
And we all kissed
And became the same
We became the same
We became the same
Who would have thought this
We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition
Keep them off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been
We are all
Cold water
Why try at all?
Why bother?
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Who would have dreamed this?
You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know
We are all
Night's fallen
Why try at all?
Dark callin'
So we're left alone
No one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
So we're left alone
No one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling




When we were coming down, they said it was too soon
I never had to lie, no, no, no, no
When were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere
I know you've been around
I feel you in and out
How are you?
Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken
I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son
Free information, free information
Free information, free informa--
Atlanta hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can buy it out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know about photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
Why I never wanna say no to you?
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
Can't hold no goose, can't hold no goose, can't hold his goose
I'ma walk out, wanna walk too?
What about dude?
Fuck it, I just wanna feel something
It took my like five minutes to figure out what voices those were on the phone
But I figured it out
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
I'm a freaky bitch
I'm 5 foot 8
390
And I am a freaky bitch
Heathen
It's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Crafmatic, making moves, but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Crying cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a brotha's preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost god never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a Watchtower
Any anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it
Kinison said if you gonna miss heaven...
Why miss it by two inches?
Old money and new bitches
(Old money and new bitches)




I watch 'em all pass by
The moon and the stars
Let me hold you in my arms forevermore
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing by the side
Let you go, oh to the sea, just for me
Don't ever let me, my love
Keep holding on
Let the modest go
As my mic goes to and fro
Waking up for one more show
We see him in the night
Tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of him
'Cause I won't know




Rainbows, sunshine, everywhere we go
Rainbows, sunshine, go
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
I thought I told you 'bout it
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
You don't leave home without it
(Move that kilo, move that kilo
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
She on my back about it
C3PO, C3PO, C3PO
And all the time
Act like you know
Act like you know
Act like you know
How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why, and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair, and she know life is better with this brotha
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look
Different, the colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
(But as long as I look fly by prom night, go)
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
He slangs, his yay, through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least for sure
And they say there's no way
I should stay with someone like you, but I tell them no
There's no way I could stray
Gotta stay with someone like you
Cause I know one day
You could take me away, far away
I know you could pay
All the money you made, there'll be plenty of sunshine
I never worry 'bout it
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
I have my brotha count it
(Back up them O's)
(Back up them O's)
(Back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold, dressed up in gold
C3PO, C3PO
I'm out of time
Act like you know
Act like you know
Act like you know
I'm out of time, I'm out of time, I'm out of time (Go)




See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day you call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me
That "A" on my chest like adultery
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, never mind
It was time, number nine, lies
Feline with a death wish
E-vite didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we're destined
See now I don't wanna see an era (an era)
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night (you and me)
Maybe it's the last night (fireworks)
Maybe it's the last night (all the stars)
Maybe it's the last night (super moon)
All that I have (it's the last night)
All I don't have's the future (it's the last night)
Take all of my soul (it's the last night)
All night (it's the last night)
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
They godless, denied us
But we don't give a damn about the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the tweet then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, never know fear
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress the only thing that will last
3005. The year that we fear, only God will survive
To be alone is alive
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night

She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY




Man made the web, you don't need a name
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these brothers
Rick Rolling these brothers, they mad cause they don't know any better
"Hold up, it's the kid, quick, tell him he can't sit with us"
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real-D, hope they dig a brotha before they bury me
Even though, we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial up, watch it pile up
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The sauce was so malo then she said "you need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song"
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone, now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying "go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out, "it's the best, " no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, keeling myself
No one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who are you? Don't do it. Who are you?)
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
brothers taking props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me "how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass, "you see what these labels do to me"
Texts said "I'm Wet", I said "hold up, wait up a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
You're here now. You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you. You have to help me
You have to help me
You have to help me
Please help me
Please help me
Please
Please help me





Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone
Who am I?
Rec League, I ain't payin' to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah. I murder some, I murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah what you saying to it?
Old money look no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ey
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her Boooty)
What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke brothers when they Black & Mild
So we acting out
Ok cool
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone

Blue dream by the bouquet 'til I'm blue faced on a Tuesday
(Can I have some?)
#brothersBeLike
Put a plus eighteen on that e-vite
And I said what I felt, no re-write
Nah nah, they can't hold me
June/July, drop something
I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut brothers, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like it's 2 Chainz
Blue Blood like he both gangs
Where we were, kinda thing
Betchya crawl, all alone




Blow up
World Star before rap, you already know that
So Fresh Prince, they are about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo, weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Phone call gotta say Moshi Moshi
Girlfriend actin' all washy washy
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Fell in love with a brotha like a mermaid
(Daddy, I love him!)
That's a first date
Nobody think about it worst case
Best case, we the front page
10K on the first day
Yeah, motherfucker, take your phone out
To record this
Ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less, a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals
Tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action, I'm a be Scorcese
(My brotha hold it horizontal man, Be professional)
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine
Thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk
But I saw through it like a wet shirt
Drive slow cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop
When I heard shots
Watchin' dude drop from a Glock at a
Let me flash on 'em
We all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talkin', you know the sound
Brrrr, money counting
Brrrr, AK
Brrrr, cell phone
Brrrr, hello?
Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man
This shit's hilarious, man. It's like this kid, man
He got like, he got like hit on the side of the head
Man, he's like freakin' out
Like, it's like
We don't wanna be a (worldstar!)
And all I wanna be is a (worldstar!)

At a Clippers game on the courtside (side)
Watch a brotha shoot like a 4-5 (five)
They mad at me, too, I got more fire
When these bitches see you, "Go home, Roger" (go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you brothers like apartheid (nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate
Instead of asking what's happenin' rather blastin'
Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker
Than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playin' Playstation
Why you standin' there? Say some', girl say some'
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house

Bought a new bath (bath), 8K, brotha
Wanna take shots? (Shots) AK, brotha
When I ball, I'ma ball King James, brotha
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, brotha
And I'm out of this world like Tang, brotha (Tang, brotha)
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you wanna play pool on my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a ménage, and murdered the vag'
But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-I-I-I, I need a minute, cold water to the face
I-I, I couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor, hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors

Uh-oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more
Yeah, no, no, no
Face down in the brown grass
Shame shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do? What you gon' do?
Like, "I can't remember"
Shots fired, rewind, please girl be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before I go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z & Beyonce, my aunt say "Keep the sex game picante"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Put my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
We ain't speaking—
We ain't speaking— (okay)
We ain't speaking though
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more, oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen—
The attitude
The attitude
And I hope you understand, I hope you understand
We were never friends
And I hope you understand now
That I messed up (oh no, no-no)
(I hope you understand) I hope you understand
Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see
I just hope you understand
I just hope you understand
I just hope you understand
I just hope you understand




I was making Japanese
And she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5
And she waits till I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me "turn around, " then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland
Foot on the gas
I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay
Babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, no
I don't really want to drive
But I think I'd rather die
In Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends
On Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old
In Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything, that I needed
Now I finally got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a brotha don't like that shit at all
So retreating
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute
Foot on the gas
I'm just tryna pass
All the red lights
And the stop signs
I'm ready to go
I'm really not ready girl
That's a problem
Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know that you choose to stay, no oh
All the girlfriends saying here we go again
Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And you're saying it's because of the Internet
Try once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have better
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at her
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah we can try
So let's try
Whoa
I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me (just hit me)
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move, and we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you, so the fuck I'm supposed to do?
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland




Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids, now she A$AP
'Bino so insensitive, she asking, "Why you say that?"
I'm chillin', real brotha feeling
Rich kid, asshole
Paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow
DJ Khaled

PH balance
Real brotha, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so
Hip deep in that Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo, you faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though?
Are you eating though? brotha, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners, you ain't even know
Never catching cases, why they faces look so e-m-o?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese
Yo' girl, she jocking these
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You brothers ain't copping these, brothers ain't looking like me
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (Why)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (Why)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (Why)
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain (Whyyy)
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you
Fuck it, what you gon' do?
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear and your girl drank my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (Silver spoon coon, ho)
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker
Vroom vroom ho
Ain't nobody
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up, just so you know
Top of the Hold 'em totem, rich forever, a million was not the quota
My father owned half of MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods and I'm too fly, Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a
White hood, white hood (Okay-kay-kay)
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dope man, help a brotha re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
"Err-err-err-err": onomatopoeia, oh, I got my cool on! (Tell 'em, mane)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name
Whyyy
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' (Whyy)




No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other brothers, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005, hold up (Okay)
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got a stripper like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
These they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other brothers, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005

I used to care what people thought
But now I care more
Man nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogain
Or leave it, like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other brothers, I'll be right by your side
Till 3005
Hold up (Hold up)

Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What does that change?
Can't sleep
3 A.M., stare at the ceilin', murder the feelin'
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate, cornucopia
So be it, say I'm over it
Playin' Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood, look at the cars
Stare at my hands, look at the moon, I can't find it, it's gone
What's wrong? Didn't respond when I texted you last night, you alright? Yeah
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What does that change?
Man there's a star bound to a body inside of me
20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry and half of an apple pie
When I'm laughin', I'm satisfied, when I'm dyin', I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood so good I'mma kill that spider
Them kinda things they told me I no longer do that, but now you finally get it admit it
Go home, lock the door, watch cartoons for an hour turn off the lights, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse
Look at the recluse
Look at the rec
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What can I say?
Don't go, gotta know
Please don't run away
I'm a murderer
What does that change?
Don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go





Slide, baby
I'm gonna let it go
No one has to know
Let it slide, baby
I'm gonna let it go
No one has to, no one, no one
Slide, baby
Wow




I had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people
So many pretty faces
I talked to some birds
I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad you were really happy
Because you were here
And I got to meet every star, every planet
Everything that made me
And we all kissed
And became the same
We became the same
We became the same
Who would have thought this
We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition
Keep them off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been
We are all
Cold water
Why try at all?
Why bother?
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Who would have dreamed this?
You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know
We are all
Night's fallen
Why try at all?
Dark callin'
So we're left alone
No one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
So we're left alone
No one left to call upon
Be still now, broken bones
As I travel on just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling
Just hold me close my darling




When we were coming down, they said it was too soon
I never had to lie, no, no, no, no
When were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere
I know you've been around
I feel you in and out
How are you?
Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken
I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son
Free information, free information
Free information, free informa--
Atlanta hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can buy it out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke, and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know about photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
Why I never wanna say no to you?
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
Can't hold no goose, can't hold no goose, can't hold his goose
I'ma walk out, wanna walk too?
What about dude?
Fuck it, I just wanna feel something
It took my like five minutes to figure out what voices those were on the phone
But I figured it out
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
Is it real? 'Cause you're online
I'm a freaky bitch
I'm 5 foot 8
390
And I am a freaky bitch
Heathen
It's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff puff pass addict
Crafmatic, making moves, but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Crying cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a brotha's preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost god never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a Watchtower
Any anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait until I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and I finish it
Kinison said if you gonna miss heaven...
Why miss it by two inches?
Old money and new bitches
(Old money and new bitches)




I watch 'em all pass by
The moon and the stars
Let me hold you in my arms forevermore
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing by the side
Let you go, oh to the sea, just for me
Don't ever let me, my love
Keep holding on
Let the modest go
As my mic goes to and fro
Waking up for one more show
We see him in the night
Tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of him
'Cause I won't know




Rainbows, sunshine, everywhere we go
Rainbows, sunshine, go
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
I thought I told you 'bout it
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
You don't leave home without it
(Move that kilo, move that kilo
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
She on my back about it
C3PO, C3PO, C3PO
And all the time
Act like you know
Act like you know
Act like you know
How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why, and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair, and she know life is better with this brotha
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look
Different, the colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
(But as long as I look fly by prom night, go)
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
He slangs, his yay, through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least for sure
And they say there's no way
I should stay with someone like you, but I tell them no
There's no way I could stray
Gotta stay with someone like you
Cause I know one day
You could take me away, far away
I know you could pay
All the money you made, there'll be plenty of sunshine
I never worry 'bout it
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
I have my brotha count it
(Back up them O's)
(Back up them O's)
(Back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold, dressed up in gold
C3PO, C3PO
I'm out of time
Act like you know
Act like you know
Act like you know
I'm out of time, I'm out of time, I'm out of time (Go)




See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day you call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me
That "A" on my chest like adultery
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, never mind
It was time, number nine, lies
Feline with a death wish
E-vite didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we're destined
See now I don't wanna see an era (an era)
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night (you and me)
Maybe it's the last night (fireworks)
Maybe it's the last night (all the stars)
Maybe it's the last night (super moon)
All that I have (it's the last night)
All I don't have's the future (it's the last night)
Take all of my soul (it's the last night)
All night (it's the last night)
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
They godless, denied us
But we don't give a damn about the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the tweet then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, never know fear
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress the only thing that will last
3005. The year that we fear, only God will survive
To be alone is alive
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night
She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
She got that body, oh me oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY




Man made the web, you don't need a name
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these brothers
Rick Rolling these brothers, they mad cause they don't know any better
"Hold up, it's the kid, quick, tell him he can't sit with us"
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real-D, hope they dig a brotha before they bury me
Even though, we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial up, watch it pile up
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave
It's that Andrew Auernheimer
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha-
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re up
Tequila in the cantina, 30 dollars I swallowed
The sauce was so malo then she said "you need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song"
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's the Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone, now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden, hurtin', they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying "go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap, Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out, "it's the best, " no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, keeling myself
No one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweeted or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just a bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who are you? Don't do it. Who are you?)
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces are shit with breakfast
Funny the day you born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversating
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
And plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talking to eat, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
brothers taking props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me "how you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, 45 like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass, "you see what these labels do to me"
Texts said "I'm Wet", I said "hold up, wait up a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's the hood I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
You're here now. You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you. You have to help me
You have to help me
You have to help me
Please help me
Please help me
Please
Please help me
